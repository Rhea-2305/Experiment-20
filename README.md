# Experiment-20
## Program 1
## Aim
Write a c++ program to do selection sorting.

## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
A sorting algorithm is used to reorganize an array or list of elements based on a comparison operator, which determines the new order of elements within the data structure. 

Selection Sort is a comparison-based algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

## Conclusion
We learnt the selection sorting algorithm in C++.

## Program 2
## Aim
Write a c++ program to do insertion sorting.

## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
Insertion sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly takes each element from an unsorted list and inserts it into its correct position within the sorted portion. It’s similar to sorting playing cards: you divide the cards into two groups—sorted and unsorted—and then place each card from the unsorted group into its proper position within the sorted group.

## Conclusion
We learnt the insertion sorting algorithm in C++.

## Program 3
